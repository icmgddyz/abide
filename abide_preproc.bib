abstract = {Functional brain networks are well described and estimated from data with Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs), e.g. using sparse inverse covariance estimators. Comparing functional connectivity of subjects in two population calls for comparing these estimated GGMs. We study the problem of identifying differences in Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs) known to have similar structure. We aim to characterize the uncertainty of differences with confidence intervals obtained using a para-metric distribution on parameters of a sparse estimator. Sparse penalties enable statistical guarantees and interpretable models even in high-dimensional and low-number-of-samples settings. Quantifying the uncertainty of the parameters selected by the sparse penalty is an important question in applications such as neuroimaging or bioinformatics. Indeed, selected variables can be interpreted to build theoretical understanding or to make therapeutic decisions. Characterizing the distributions of sparse regression models is inherently challenging since the penalties produce a biased estimator. Recent work has shown how one can invoke the sparsity assumptions to effectively remove the bias from a sparse estimator such as the lasso. These distributions can be used to give us confidence intervals on edges in GGMs, and by extension their differences. However, in the case of comparing GGMs, these estimators do not make use of any assumed joint structure among the GGMs. Inspired by priors from brain functional connectivity we focus on deriving the distribution of parameter differences under a joint penalty when parameters are known to be sparse in the difference. This leads us to introduce the debiased multi-task fused lasso. We show that we can debias and characterize the distribution in an efficient manner. We then go on to show how the debiased lasso and multi-task fused lasso can be used to obtain confidence intervals on edge differences in Gaussian graphical models. We validate the techniques proposed on a set of synthetic examples as well as neuro-imaging dataset created for the study of autism.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) encompasses a complex manifestation of symptoms that include deficits in social interaction and repetitive or stereotyped interests and behaviors. In keeping with the increasing recognition of the dimensional characteristics of ASD symptoms and the categorical nature of a diagnosis, we sought to delineate the neural mechanisms of ASD symptoms based on the functional connectivity of four known neural networks (i.e., default mode network, dorsal attention network, salience network, and executive control network).

METHODS: We leveraged an open data resource (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) providing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data sets from 90 boys with ASD and 95 typically developing boys. This data set also included the Social Responsiveness Scale as a dimensional measure of ASD traits. Seed-based functional connectivity was paired with linear regression to identify functional connectivity abnormalities associated with categorical effects of ASD diagnosis, dimensional effects of ASD-like behaviors, and their interaction.

RESULTS: Our results revealed the existence of dimensional mechanisms of ASD uniquely affecting each network based on the presence of connectivity-behavioral relationships; these were independent of diagnostic category. However, we also found evidence of categorical differences (i.e., diagnostic group differences) in connectivity strength for each network as well as categorical differences in connectivity-behavioral relationships (i.e., diagnosis-by-behavior interactions), supporting the coexistence of categorical mechanisms of ASD.

CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support a hybrid model for ASD characterization that includes a combination of categorical and dimensional brain mechanisms and provide a novel understanding of the neural underpinnings of ASD.},

abstract = {This paper presents an approach for automatic diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) among males using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). fMRI has the capability to identify any abnormal neural interactions that may be responsible for behavioral symptoms observed in ASD patients. In this paper, the regional homogeneity of the voxels in the 116 regions of the automated anatomical labeling (AAL) atlas of the brain are used as features which result in a large set of 54837 features. Chi-square feature selection method is then used to identify the most significant features and only these features are then used for classification with a metacognitive radial basis function classifier. Since genetic studies have indicated that ASD manifests differently in males and females, a large scale study specific to males is highlighted here using the publicly available preprocessed fMRI dataset from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE), unlike existing studies which are either smaller in scale or consider both males and females together. Among the males, it is shown here that the classification performance can be improved (by up to 10{\%}) by considering adults and adolescents separately. By using Chi-square algorithm the number of features was reduced drastically to lower than 200 in contrast to the thousands of features that have been used in recent studies.},

abstract = {A powerful new method is described called Knowledge based functional connectivity Enrichment Analysis (KEA) for interpreting resting state functional connectivity, using circuits that are functionally identified using search terms with the Neurosynth database. The method derives its power by focusing on neural circuits, sets of brain regions that share a common biological function, instead of trying to interpret single functional connectivity links. This provides a novel way of investigating how task- or function-related related networks have resting state functional connectivity differences in different psychiatric states, provides a new way to bridge the gap between task and resting-state functional networks, and potentially helps to identify brain networks that might be treated. The method was applied to interpreting functional connectivity differences in autism. Functional connectivity decreases at the network circuit level in 394 patients with autism compared with 473 controls were found in networks involving the orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, middle temporal gyrus cortex, and the precuneus, in networks that are implicated in the sense of self, face processing, and theory of mind. The decreases were correlated with symptom severity.},

abstract={The dynamic organization of human brain functional networks can be revealed through resting-state fMRI. It is still an open question about how to determine the essential factors underlying the dynamic activity of human brain. In this study, we proposed the assumption that the dynamic activity of brain was companied with various involvements of latent active patterns (LAPs). We further supposed that LAPs were sparsely involved with different brain states. We modeled the assumptions by adopting a dictionary-learning framework. An online dictionary learning method was used to calculate the LAPs and the sparse loading parameters. Based on the results obtained from the resting-state fMRI dataset, we found some commonly represented LAPs that were involved with the default mode network, salience network and frontoparietal attention network. The sparse represented LAPs at each time point were related with the time-varying activity. LAPs provided a new viewpoint to mine the factors related with the dynamic organization of brain activity.},
